# rxmc
Uncertainty quantification and calibration of reaction models with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo, with flexible and composable models for the likelihood and corpus of constraints.
- Curate a corpus of experimental constraints using [`exfor_tools`](https://github.com/beykyle/exfor_tools)
- Efficiently calculate corresponding observables using [`jitR`](https://github.com/beykyle/jitr)
- Choose from a variety of likelihood models, or extend the basic [`Constraint`]() class to implement your own.

An example of this code in use is in the development of the [East Lansing Model](https://github.com/beykyle/elm)
